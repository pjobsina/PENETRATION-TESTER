`Vulnerability assessments` are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).
## BLACK BOX
- `Black box` pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. 
- Often the customer will ask the pentester to show them discovered internal/external IP addresses/network ranges so they can confirm ownership and note down any hosts that should be considered out-of-scope.
## GREY BOX
- `Grey box` pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an `employee` who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a `receptionist` or `customer service agent`. 
- The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.
## WHITE BOX
- `White box` pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope. 
- The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.
# Vulnerability Assessment
## Vulnerability
- A `Vulnerability` is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors. 
- Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's [Common Vulnerability Exposure database](https://cve.mitre.org/) and receive a [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score to determine severity.
## Threat
- A `Threat` is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. 
- Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited. 
- For example, the higher the reward of the outcome and ease of exploitation, the more likely the issue would be exploited by threat actors.
## Exploit
- An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. 
- Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as [Exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com) or [the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). 
- We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well.
## Risk
- `Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.
## Difference
To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:
- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat
# Reporting
A strong report consists of the following sections:
- Executive Summary
- Overview of Assessment
- Scope
- Vulnerabilities and Recommendations
## Executive Summary
- The `Executive Summary` of a vulnerability assessment report is intended to be readable by an executive who needs a high-level overview of the details and what is the most important items to fix immediately, depending on the severity. 
- This section allows an executive to look at the report and prioritize remediations based on the summary.
## Overview of Assessment
- The `Overview of the Assessment` should include any methodology leveraged during the assessment. 
- The methodology should detail the execution of the assessment during the testing period, such as discussing the process and tools used for the project (e.g., Nessus).
## Scope and Duration
- The `Scope and Duration` section of the report should include everything the client authorized for the assessment, including the target scope and the testing period.
## Vulnerabilities and Recommendations
- The `Vulnerabilities and Recommendations` section should detail the findings discovered during the vulnerability assessment once you've eliminated any false positives by manually testing them. 
- It is best to group findings that relate to each other based on the type of issues or their severity.
Each issue should have the following elements:
- Vulnerability Name
- CVE
- CVSS
- Description of Issue
- References
- Remediation Steps
- Proof of Concept
- Affected Systems
## Closing
- The reporting portion of any assessment is the most crucial part of the project. Always make sure you are writing your reports such that any audience can read them. 
- When discussing technical information, always reference what you describe for the reader to understand or reproduce what you are talking about in the report. 
- Additionally, sentences should be to the point with proper grammar as well. 
- The strongest reports are concise and clear for a reader.
